# üß† Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship program. The goal is to implement and understand the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm using Scikit-learn, applied on a classification dataset.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used for this task is provided in the file `archive.zip`. It is a classification dataset, which was preprocessed and used to train and evaluate the KNN model.

---

## üìå What Was Done

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Checked and handled any missing values.
- Split the dataset into features (X) and labels (y).

### 2. Normalization
- Normalized the feature values using `StandardScaler`.
- Normalization is important in KNN since it relies on distance metrics.

### 3. KNN Model Training
- Used `KNeighborsClassifier` from Scikit-learn.
- Trained the model using different values of **K** (like 3, 5, and 7).
- Chose the best K based on accuracy and performance metrics.

### 4. Evaluation
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

### 5. Visualization
- Plotted decision boundaries using Matplotlib.
- Visualized how KNN separates different classes based on feature space.

## üìä Results

| K Value | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
|   3    |  XX.X%   |
|   5    |  XX.X%   |
|   7    |  XX.X%   |

> Replace `XX.X%` with actual accuracy values from your notebook.
